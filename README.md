---EXCH BID: buys from client | EXCH OFFER: sells to client
                                100 x 10.15
                                300 x 10.12
                                100 x 10.09
100 x 10.05
300 x 10.02
200 x 9.80

  you sell at BID            | you buy at OFFER
  
Highest exchange BID is on top = best price exch willing
to pay for your stock

Lowest exchange OFFER is on top = best(lowest) price 
exch is willing to sell its stock for.

In other words book prices are sorted with respect to what
is best for the client who either 
BUYS = spends money and get exch stock
SELLS = gets money for his stock.
